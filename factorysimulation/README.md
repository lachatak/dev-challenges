## Car Factory Simulation ##

This is my solution for **Dev Challenges** series [Car Factory Simulation](CHALLENGE.md) section.

### Tool set ###
- [Akka Streams](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/1.0-RC4/scala.html?_ga=1.167543678.1764891530.1418773886) to have actor and streams support to wire the factory
- [InfluxDB](https://influxdb.com/) to save timeseries information of the production line
- [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) to visualize car factory timeseries
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to wrap services and make them shippable for different environments
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to be able to start up the entire car factory with 1 single command
